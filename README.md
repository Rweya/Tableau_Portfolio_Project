Project Background
This project is a comprehensive analysis of airline customer reviews spanning from March 2016 to October 2023. It tracks customer satisfaction based on several metrics, such as overall rating, cabin staff service, entertainment, ground service, and seat comfort. The dashboard aggregates ratings across different seat types (Business Class, Economy Class, First Class, and Premium Economy), and traveler types (Business, Solo Leisure, Couple Leisure, etc.). Additionally, it provides insights into how aircraft models and regions (countries) affect overall customer ratings.

Key Insights and Recommendations:
1. Overall Rating Trend (By Month):
The ratings fluctuate over time, with some noticeable peaks and troughs between 2017 and 2023. The overall trend indicates that while customer satisfaction has moments of improvement, there have been consistent dips.

2. Country-wise Rating Analysis:
The map reveals varying ratings across countries, with darker green indicating higher satisfaction and lighter shades indicating lower satisfaction.

3. Aircraft Rating Performance:
The Boeing 747-400 leads in customer satisfaction with an average rating of 4.7, while the A321 aircraft has the lowest rating at 3.6.

4. Review Volume vs. Satisfaction:
Aircraft with the highest number of reviews (such as A320 and Boeing 777-200) tend to have lower average ratings.

5. Traveler Type and Seat Type Insights:
Different traveler and seat types might influence ratings, although this isn't immediately visible in the current dashboard.

Executive Summary

Overview of Findings
The analysis of British Airways' reviews, covering multiple dimensions such as cabin staff service, entertainment, food, and seat comfort, reveals a mixed performance. The average overall rating stands at 4.2, indicating a generally positive but somewhat inconsistent customer experience. Several key areas, such as entertainment and value for money, show low satisfaction levels, while aircraft-specific ratings demonstrate notable variability in passenger satisfaction across different plane models.

Short Trends:
1.	Fluctuating Overall Ratings (2016 - 2023):
o	Ratings have shown significant fluctuation over the years, with a sharp decline observed around 2020-2021, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been some recovery since then, but ratings have not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels.
2.	Low Entertainment Ratings:
o	The entertainment category has a notably low rating of 1.4, highlighting it as a major weakness in the customer experience.
3.	Aircraft Performance:
o	The Boeing 747-400 leads with the highest customer satisfaction (average rating of 4.7), followed by other Boeing models, while the A380 and Boeing 777-200 lag behind with lower ratings (around 3.8-3.9).
4.	Geographical Variance:
o	Passengers from different countries offer varying ratings, with some regions providing more favorable feedback than others, though no extreme differences are visible across the map.
Performance:
•	Strong Areas:
o	The overall rating of 4.2 suggests that British Airways maintains a positive reputation, especially in areas such as aircraft comfort on certain models like the Boeing 747-400.
o	The cabin staff service scores a moderate 3.3, indicating that while there's room for improvement, customers are generally satisfied with staff interaction.
•	Weak Areas:
o	Entertainment is a significant underperformer at 1.4, reflecting dissatisfaction with in-flight media options or connectivity.
o	Food and Beverage has a low average of 2.4, suggesting passengers are unimpressed with the dining options provided.
o	Value for Money (average 2.8) points to a gap between the pricing of tickets and the perceived value of services offered.

Overall Recommendation:
1.	Focus on Entertainment Improvements: British Airways should prioritize upgrading their in-flight entertainment systems, including more diverse media choices and better technology, as this is currently the lowest-rated service.
2.	Revamp Food and Beverage Services: Improving meal quality and variety could enhance the passenger experience, especially on long-haul flights where dining is a key part of customer satisfaction.
3.	Address Seat Comfort: With a rating of 2.9, British Airways should consider adjusting seat configurations or investing in more comfortable seating options across their fleet, particularly on models like the A380 and Boeing 777-200, which have received lower scores.
4.	Leverage High-Performing Aircraft Models: Given that the Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 787 perform well, British Airways can focus on replicating the features of these aircraft across other models to boost overall satisfaction.
5.	Tailor Strategies by Region: Regional differences in ratings suggest an opportunity for localized strategies, potentially through targeted marketing, service adjustments, or cultural accommodations.
